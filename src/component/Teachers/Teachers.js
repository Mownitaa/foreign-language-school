            <p className="bg-light px-5 py-3 fw-bold lh-lg">Through language, people develop their identity, express feelings and thoughts and understand how others feel and think. The teaching of your native language should be aimed at developing skills in that language and that you learn about the background and culture behind the language.
                To get the maximum of it our courses will be learning from native speakers and certified teachers from all over the world and with motivated classmates from around the world.
